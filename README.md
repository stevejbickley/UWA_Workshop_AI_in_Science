# How Can I Use AI to Help My Academic Research?
**Research Skills Workshop** | **ARC Training Centre for Behavioural Insights for Technology Adoption**


* **Facilitator:** Dr. Steve Bickley
* **Date:** 29 April 2025
* **Time:** 4-6 pm AEST
* **Location:** G013 Agriculture Lecture Theatre at UWA (University of Western Australia), Crawley Campus; Online via Microsoft Teams
* **Attendance:** 120+ attendees in total (*85+ online and 35+ in-person*)


## Overview

This workshop explores the practical and critical use of AI tools throughout the academic research process. Participants will engage with examples, demos, and hands-on activities designed to:

* Accelerate literature discovery and synthesis

* Generate hypotheses and design experiments

* Use AI for data analysis and simulation

* Improve drafting, revision, and logic of academic writing

* Critically evaluate risks, biases, and appropriate boundaries of AI in scholarly work

The session includes both conceptual explanation and practical demonstration, with links to tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Elicit, and GitHub Copilot.


## Contents

[demo_prompts.md](./demo_prompts.md): Sample prompt cards for key academic research tasks

[slide18_20_demos.md](./slide18_20_demos.md): Demos related to literature synthesis, idea generation, and experimental design (writing + elicit)

[slide24_data_demo.md](./slide24_data_demo.md): Programming/data analysis demo (e.g., cleaning and modelling using uploaded CSV dataset)

[ai_disclosure_templates.md](./ai_disclosure_templates.md): Ready-to-copy disclosure snippets (writing help, data coding, literature searches, figure generation, etc.), plus a catch-all statement and a Turnitin/iThenticate note.

[ai_plagiarism_guidance.md](./ai_plagiarism_guidance.md): A post-workshop handout summarising: why first-pass LLM text can sound “same-y” (especially with simple prompts); the “interaction-fluents” method for iterative prompting; a guard-rail checklist (plagiarism checker, manual + AI literature search); and the GPT-4o “sycophancy” rollback as a human-AI co-evolution case study. **The handout includes links to ARC BITA’s LinkedIn & YouTube for the workshop recording.**

[Bickley_UWA_AIinAcademicResearch_28Apr2025.pdf](./Bickley_UWA_AIinAcademicResearch_28Apr2025.pdf): Slide deck for Steve’s UWA guest workshop “How Can I Use AI to Help My Academic Research?” (29 Apr 2025).

[Crimes_-_One_year_prior_to_present.csv](./Crimes_-_One_year_prior_to_present.csv): 1-year sample of Chicago Police Department incident reports ([public open-data portal](./https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crimes-one-year-prior-to-present)). Used on slide 24 to demo quick exploratory analysis with GPT-assisted Python (time constraints meant the live demo was skipped).
