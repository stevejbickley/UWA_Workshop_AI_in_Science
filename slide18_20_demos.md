# Slide 18–20: Writing, Literature Review, and Experimental Design Demos

These demos correspond to Slides 18–20 of the workshop and showcase how to use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Elicit) to assist with research writing, reviewing literature, and pre-testing survey design.


## Writing & Argument Development (Slide 18)

### Live Demo Options:

Paste in rough notes or bullet points → Ask:

"Help me write a paragraph in academic tone from these notes."

Paste a rough draft → Ask:

"Revise this paragraph for clarity, logical flow, and conciseness."

Writing logic checker:

"Does the conclusion in this paragraph logically follow from the results presented above?"

Tool Suggestions: Claude, ChatGPT


## Literature Review via Elicit (Slide 19)

### Live Demo Task:

Visit: https://elicit.org

Enter a question like:

"What are the effects of universal basic income on labor supply?"

### In-app Prompts:

Use the pre-filled schema (PICO: Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)

Refine results → Export summaries or use structured overview

### Additional Prompt for Claude/GPT:

"For each of the following papers: [paste], extract aim, method, findings, and limitations."


## Experiment or Survey Design (Slide 20)

### Basic Hypothesis Drafting

"I want to test whether [intervention] improves [outcome]. What’s a simple experimental design I could use?"

### Question Testing Variants

"Suggest 3 alternate phrasings of this survey item to test framing sensitivity."

### Simulated Pre-Test Using AI Participants

"Assume the role of a 40-year-old parent. How would you respond to this survey question: [insert]?"
