# AI Assistance Disclosure Templates for Academic Manuscripts

Below are mix‑and‑match blocks you can tailor to meet your journal’s wording limits: explicitly stating **which tool, when, how**, and the authors’ verification steps.

Replace bracketed text `[…]` with specifics and remove any lines that do not apply.


## 1  Writing, Editing & Style‑Polish

**Template**

> Portions of the manuscript’s prose were drafted or re‑phrased with AI assistance using **[model name/version]** accessed via **[platform/API]** during **[month‑year range]**. The authors reviewed, fact‑checked and substantively edited all AI‑generated text to ensure accuracy and originality.

**Example**

> GPT‑4o‑2024‑04 (ChatGPT Plus, chat.openai.com) suggested alternate phrasings for the Introduction and edits in section 3 for clarity (accessed Mar–Apr 2025). All wording was subsequently verified and revised by the authors.


## 2  Idea Generation / Outline Scaffolding

> An outline and preliminary section headings were brainstormed interactively with GPT‑4o‑2024‑04 via the OpenAI API (temperature ≤ 0.5) in Apr 2025. Final structure and content were determined by the authors.


## 3  Data Extraction, Coding or Simulation

> Survey responses (*n = 4 812*) were parsed with **[tool/library]** and then labelled using GPT‑4o‑2024‑08‑06 (OpenAI Chat Completions API) under a custom rubric from Aug–Sep 2025. All labels with model confidence < 0.8 were manually inspected and XX % were corrected.


## 4  Literature Search & Synthesis

> A hybrid search combined manual database queries (Scopus, Web of Science, last run 15 Feb 2025) with semantic expansion via GPT‑4o‑2024‑08‑06 (Perplexity.ai academic mode, accessed Feb 2025). All citations were cross‑checked for existence and relevance; nine spurious references were discarded.


## 5  Statistical Analysis Assistance

> Code stubs for the Difference‑in‑Differences model were generated with Copilot Chat (GitHub Copilot, GPT‑4‑Turbo, accessed Jan 2025). The final R scripts were rewritten and validated by the authors.


## 6  Translation

> The Spanish abstract was initially translated by DeepL Pro (v3.4, April 2025) and refined by a native‑speaker co‑author.



## 7  General Catch‑All Statement

> The authors used generative‑AI tools for limited support tasks (idea brainstorming, language editing, code suggestions and reference expansion) between Jan–Apr 2025. Tools included ChatGPT‑GPT‑4o (chat.openai.com) and GitHub Copilot. All outputs were critically evaluated, revised and verified; responsibility for the content rests solely with the authors.



## Bonus: Plagiarism / Originality Note

> All AI‑assisted text was screened with Turnitin iThenticate (v2.1, 22 Apr 2025); no uncited overlap was detected.
