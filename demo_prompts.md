# Demo Prompt Cards for Academic Research

These structured prompts are designed to support academic tasks using LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude). They can be used as-is or adapted during workshops or self-paced learning.

## Literature Review & Gap Identification

Prompt 1 – Structured Summary of Multiple Papers:

For each of the following papers, extract: 1) objective, 2) research question, 3) method, 4) data source, 5) key findings, 6) limitations, and 7) contributions.

Prompt 2 – Identify Gaps and Novel Ideas:

Based on the combined findings from these studies, what open research questions remain? Suggest 2–3 new directions or hypotheses.

Prompt 3 – Concept Map (Advanced):

Generate a conceptual map of how the key ideas and methods relate across these papers. Highlight overlaps and differences.

## Survey/Experiment Design

Prompt 4 – Hypothesis Testing Plan:

I want to test the hypothesis: [insert H]. What experiment or survey design would you suggest? List variables, measures, and sample considerations.

Prompt 5 – Question Refinement:

Here are my survey questions. Suggest 3 variations for each to test sensitivity and framing effects. Highlight any bias or ambiguity.

## Academic Writing & Feedback

Prompt 6 – Draft Support:

Here are my rough notes or findings: [paste content]. Help me draft an academic-style paragraph that communicates these clearly.

Prompt 7 – Argument Logic Check:

Does this paragraph logically support the conclusion I’m making? What assumptions need to be made explicit?

Prompt 8 – Reviewer Simulation:

Read my abstract/introduction. What 2–3 concerns might a reviewer raise, and how could I address them?

## Statistical Suggestions or Coding Help

Prompt 9 – Statistical Test Selector:

I have a dependent variable that is [type] and a sample of [size/type]. What statistical approach would be appropriate and why?

Prompt 10 – Code Fixer:

Here is my error message and the code: [insert]. What’s causing the issue, and how can I fix or rewrite it?

Each of these can be used live in tools like Claude, ChatGPT, or Elicit during the workshop or for follow-up experimentation.
